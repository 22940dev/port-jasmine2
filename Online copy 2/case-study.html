   <h6>Introduction</h6>
    <p>For this project I created a travel app called “Hike It” for people visiting Northern Ireland.</p>  
        
    <p>Northern Ireland has stunning scenery with deep mountain valleys, sharp cliffs that tower high above the sea, as well as cultural cities.<br> <br>Therefore, I picked out three locations to highlight in my app. The three hikes are Cuilcagh, Cave Hill and The Mourne Mountains. I also have 5 screens: Launch Screen, Category and Description screen 1-3.</p>    
     
   <h6>The Case</h6> 
    <p>I spent some time in the beginning looking at hiking guides and other people’s travel experiences to gain a broad knowledge on important information such as average durability, difficulty, etc. <br> <br>Because let’s face it. Little is worse than hiking a six-hour long trail which specifically says one to two hours on a map/app.</p>

  <div class="column3">       
    <img src="img/draft1.jpg" alt="Snow" style="width:100%">
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <img src="img/draft2.jpg" alt="Forest" style="width:100%">
  </div>
  </div>
        
            
 
    <p>I then moved onto paper sketching and having hiked all locations previously was helpful when it came to designing content and illustrations. For my logo and three hikes, I took inspiration from personal photographs and simple graphic elements on Dribbble and Behance.<br> <br>When researching iconography for my important information section, I found the website The Noun Project really inspiring when it came to designing my own icons.</p>

  <div class="column">       
    <img src="img/hikes1.jpg" alt="Snow" style="height:180px;width:114%">
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <img src="img/hikes2.jpg" alt="Forest" style="height:180px;width:114%">
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <img src="img/hikes3.jpg" alt="Mountains" style="height:180px;width:114%">
  </div>
</div> 
    
      
        
    <p>Obstacles that I faced during this project was for example that I was very new to Adobe Illustrator at the time, so it took me a lot of time and effort to digitalize the illustrations. And with that in mind, I could have toned down the level of detail and simplified the illustrations. I also wish I spent more time aligning my illustrations to make them more consistent.</p> 
    
    
     <div class="row">
  <div class="column2">       
    <img src="img/apps1.jpg" alt="Snow" style="width:100%">
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <img src="img/apps2.jpg" alt="Forest" style="width:100%">
  </div>
  </div>
 

     
    <h6>Summary</h6>
    <p>All in all, I’m happy with the outcome, and despite strict time constraints and unfamiliar software, I was able to create numerous sketches and layouts before digitalizing them in Adobe Illustrator, which I now will say I’m very familiar with.</p>
