      <h5>Personal Branding</h5>
     
    
    <h6>Overview</h6>
        <p>For this project I created a brand identity to best describe my creative self.</p>

   <h6>Introduction</h6>
    <p>First of all, what is a monogram, visual marque and wordmark?<br>A monogram is usually a design consisting of two or more letters to form a symbol. A visual marque is often used as a visual element of a brand and a wordmark is usually a text-only element of a brand.</p>  
    <br>    
    <p>This project was in many ways an enjoyable and valuable learning experience when it comes to brand image. I had fun developing my brand elements and finding my own aesthetic values, all while learning about logos, visual elements and language.</p>

   <h6>The Case</h6> 
    <p>I spent the first few weeks researching famous and aesthetically pleasing monograms such as Calvin Klein, Gucci, Chanel, Louis Vuitton and many more. I was particularly drawn to sleek shapes and modern touches.<br> <br>I also drew numerous wordmarks, visual marques and especially monograms which I narrowed down to a few I liked.</p>    
  
       
     <div class="row">
  <div class="column5">       
    <img src="img/mon1.jpg" alt="Snow" style="width:100%">
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <img src="img/mon2.jpg" alt="Forest" style="width:100%">
  </div>
  </div>
               
           
    <p>After creating a monogram based on my initials G and E, the branding process became a little easier as I could use my monogram to create nice contrasts when designing a visual marque and wordmark.</p>    
        
    <p>I began researching famous visual marques such as Airbnb, Dropbox, Instagram and many more.<br> <br>What struck me early though is that my first name is Gro, a Scandinavian name that literally means to grow. I am also growing as a designer, so it felt natural for me to involve growth and progress in some way.<br> <br>I then experimented with roots, plants and earth tones which eventually led to my leaf-circled visual marque.</p> 
            
    <p>I then began to explore wordmarks and their important role as part of a considered brand identity. After researching numerous typefaces and fonts on websites such as Typewolf, Google Fonts, Behance and etc. I became especially fond by the Sans-serif typeface and fonts like Avenir Next, Helvetica and Simplifica.<br> <br>I ended up choosing Avenir Next for my wordmark because it is minimal, futuristic and professional like my monogram and visual marque.</p>  
            
    <p>Obstacles I faced during this project was for example that I felt I was being too much of a perfectionist in a way that I tried to improve and perfect every little detail, which turned out to be be very stressful towards the end of my deadline. I overcame this obstacle by realising that designs can always be reworked and refined, and I have been introduced to many work techniques through this course, which has helped me a lot. Like the saying goes, work smarter, not harder. The idea of building a brand identity was also very intimidating but the power of step-by-step is strong so the design process was not as bad as it seemed to be.</p>

    <h6>Summary</h6>
    <p>All in all, I am happy with the result, and I think the monogram, visual marque and wordmark goes well together. They do not fight for attention and that is something I had in mind from the very start.  </p>
